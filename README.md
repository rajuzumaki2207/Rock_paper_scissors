# Rock_paper_scissors
This is a basic image classification project using tensorflow_datasets on recognizing rock paper and scissors game. I have used simple NN, CNN and other framework for achieving appropriate accuracy. As input data consists of limited images we find simple CNN does not do well with new data and tend to overfit.
